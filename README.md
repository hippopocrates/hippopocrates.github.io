## Bullshit -- The Card game
In this app, I used AJAX and a card deck API along with your basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I have several bugs I couldn't solve for the life of me. For some reason, when one opponent accuses the other of lying, the game either stops working. I think it might have something to do with my discard functionality. Also, when I get caught lying, a turn to accuse/not accuse someone of BS is skipped.
